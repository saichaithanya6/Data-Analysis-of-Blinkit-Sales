## Tuples VS Lists


Mutability:
•	Tuples: Immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
•	Lists: Mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements.
  
Performance:
•	Tuples:
Generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists, especially for large datasets.
•	Lists:
Slower and can consume more memory than tuples due to their dynamic nature.

Use Cases:
•	Tuples:
Use when you have a collection of items that should not change, such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments.
•	Lists:
Use when you need to modify the collection of items, such as adding or removing elements.



### When can we use tuple over list in python

In Python, tuples and lists are both used to store collections of items, but they have different characteristics that make them suitable for different use cases. Below are situations where tuples are preferable over lists:
Immutability:
•	Use tuples when you need a collection that should not change after its creation. This immutability makes tuples more predictable and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.
Performance:
•	Tuples are more memory-efficient and faster than lists for iteration and operations. Use tuples when performance is a concern, especially with large datasets.
Key in Dictionaries or Set Elements:
•	Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in sets because they are hashable (immutable). 
Heterogeneous Data:
•	When the collection of items of different types and each position has a specific meaning, tuples are often preferred over lists.



#### let's say you hypothesize that when the ceo of a public company resigns, the company's share share price goes down. how would you go about testing your hypothesis.

Testing the hypothesis that a CEO's resignation leads to a decline in a company's share price involves formulating a clear approach using statistical and analytical methods. Here's a step-by-step outline:

1. Define the Hypothesis
•	Null Hypothesis (H0H_0H0): The CEO's resignation has no significant impact on the company's share price.
•	Alternative Hypothesis (H1H_1H1): The CEO's resignation causes the company's share price to decrease.
________________________________________
2. Collect Data
•	Identify Events: Obtain a list of public companies where the CEO has resigned. Include the resignation date for each event.
•	Stock Price Data: Collect daily stock prices for these companies:
o	At least 6 months before and 6 months after the resignation.
o	Include market indices (e.g., S&P 500) to account for overall market trends.
•	Control Data: For comparison, gather stock price data for companies without CEO resignations in a similar period.
________________________________________
3. Preprocess the Data
•	Adjust stock prices for corporate actions (e.g., splits or dividends).
•	Normalize stock prices to reflect percentage changes, e.g., daily percentage returns.
•	Align resignation dates to create an event window (e.g., -30 days to +30 days relative to the resignation date).
________________________________________
4. Analyze the Data
a. Event Study Analysis:
•	Calculate abnormal returns (AR):
o	ARi=Ri−E(Ri)AR_i = R_i - E(R_i)ARi=Ri−E(Ri)
o	RiR_iRi: Actual return of the stock.
o	E(Ri)E(R_i)E(Ri): Expected return, often modeled using a market model:
	E(Ri)=α+βRmE(R_i) = \alpha + \beta R_mE(Ri)=α+βRm
	RmR_mRm: Market return.
•	Aggregate abnormal returns across the event window to calculate the cumulative abnormal return (CAR):
o	CAR=∑t=−TTARtCAR = \sum_{t=-T}^{T} AR_tCAR=∑t=−TTARt
b. Compare Pre- and Post-Resignation:
•	Use statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to compare mean returns before and after the resignation.
•	Analyze whether the CAR around the resignation event (e.g., t=−1t=-1t=−1 to t=+1t=+1t=+1) is significantly negative.
c. Control Group Comparison:
•	Compare the returns of companies experiencing CEO resignations with similar companies that did not.
________________________________________
5. Address Confounding Factors
•	Control for external factors that might influence stock prices (e.g., market volatility, industry-specific trends, macroeconomic events).
•	Consider using multivariate regression analysis:
o	Dependent Variable: Stock price changes.
o	Independent Variables: CEO resignation (binary), market index returns, company-specific factors.
________________________________________
6. Interpret Results
•	If the CAR during the event window is significantly negative, and the control group shows no such decline, this supports the hypothesis.
•	Ensure robustness by testing different event windows and analyzing subgroups (e.g., by industry or company size).
________________________________________
8. Communicate Results
•	Visualize the findings:
o	Plot stock price changes around resignation events.
o	Show CAR trends with confidence intervals.
•	Clearly articulate insights and their implications for investors and policymakers.



                                                    

## Classes and Objects
A class is like a blueprint for an object. The class defines the structure of the object, while the object is an actual instance of what that blueprint defines.
A class defines the data associated with the object, the attributes of the object, as well as the functions that can be used to manipulate the object – the methods.
Here we have an example of the instantiation of an object from the list class:

my_list = list("abcde")

The object is created through the list class, and is stored in the variable my_list.
The type of the object can be checked using the type() method:

print(my_list)
print(type(my_list))

Output:
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
<class 'list'>

The output tells us that the my_list object is an instance of the list class.

We can use the dir() method to view all the attributes and methods associated with an object as a result of it being an instance of a particular class:
print(dir(my_list))
Output 
['__add__', '__class__', … 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']

The output of the dir() method lists the attributes associated with an instance of the list class. The __class__ attribute can be accessed to show what class the object belongs to.

  
Classes Are Objects
Let’s see what happens when we call the __class__ attribute on the list class itself, like so:
print(my_list.__class__.__class__)
Output:
<class 'type'>


A metaclass is a class that allows for other classes to be instantiated as objects of the metaclass.
In our example, the type class is an example of a metaclass, and the list class is an instance (or object) of the type class.




In the context of object-oriented programming, a blueprint refers to a template or design that specifies the structure and behavior of objects. A class acts as this blueprint.

Explanation of the Blueprint:
Structure: A class defines what attributes (variables) an object will have. For example, if you have a Car class, the attributes could include color, make, and model.
Behavior: A class also defines what methods (functions) the object can perform. For the Car class, methods might include start(), stop(), or accelerate().
When you create an object (or instance) from the class, you are creating a specific realization of this blueprint. Each object can have its own values for the attributes defined in the class.

Real-World Analogy:
Imagine a blueprint of a house:

The blueprint specifies the design: how many rooms, doors, and windows the house will have.
The house (object) is the actual building constructed based on that blueprint.
You can create multiple houses (objects), each built from the same blueprint (class), but with variations like different paint colors or furniture (attribute values).
Example in Python:
python
Copy code
# Class (Blueprint)
class Car:
    def __init__(self, color, make, model):
        self.color = color
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
    
    def start(self):
        print(f"The {self.color} {self.make} {self.model} has started.")
    
    def stop(self):
        print(f"The {self.color} {self.make} {self.model} has stopped.")

# Creating Objects (Instances)
car1 = Car("Red", "Toyota", "Camry")  # Object 1
car2 = Car("Blue", "Honda", "Civic")  # Object 2

# Using the Objects
car1.start()  # Output: The Red Toyota Camry has started.
car2.stop()   # Output: The Blue Honda Civic has stopped.
In this example:

Car is the blueprint (class) that defines the structure and behavior of all cars.
car1 and car2 are objects (instances) created based on the blueprint, each with its own unique attribute values (color, make, model).
